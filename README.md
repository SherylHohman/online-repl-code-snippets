# online-repl-code-snippets
Some of the code snippets I have saved in online repls, like repl.it, codesandbox.com, etc


### 
## 200322 php emailer - test form data and resulting email  
file: php-emailer-test-form-data-and-resulting-email
(should have .php extension, but I dunno how to edit the filename on github)

repl-it has the most up-to-date version:  
https://repl.it/@sherylhohman/php-emailer-test-form-data-and-resulting-email  
github url: (may not be up to date) 
https://github.com/SherylHohman/online-repl-code-snippets/master/php-emailer-test-form-data-and-resulting-email.php  
or 
https://github.com/SherylHohman/online-repl-code-snippets/blob/master/php-emailer-test-form-data-and-resulting-email


Shows what the email formatting looks like, and tests code for errors.  
Should create/populate a $_POST var instead.  

## OTHERS  
(just did not take time to post them ib here)
